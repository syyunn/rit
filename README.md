reverse informational theory on lobbying

# design
add some visualization how you create multivariate signals to causal graph per legisators and summarize those (more than 400 * 20 years?) to one .. MEAN OF GRAPH

# methodological issues

Sparsity
- Sparse Granger Casuality 

Discrete 
- Categorical Granger https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/20M133097X

Any other data types? (other than ts) 
- like before/after probability distribution (averaged out)

Transfer Entropy 
  - Relation to G-Causality 
    - Granger causality and transfer entropy are equivalent for Gaussian variables https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4514

  - Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Transfer Entropy Graph

* note that Transfer Entropy is studied with Granger Causality because of its equivalence on Gaussian Assumption
